# PFC_JN
PFC paper for JN
Main scripts: ExtractData, ProcessData, RunAnalysis

Ran ExtractData to extract the data
Ran ProcessData for early level processing
Ran RunAnalysis for all analysis for the current paper version

features txts list the scripts those scripts call.
when they were not in the PFCpaperscripts folder of my dropbox,
I have copied them from other folders they were in to this 'Helper_scripts' folder

This was last backed up from dropbox and organized on 10/31/2020 
when I sent David my drafts response to the reviewer comments from Journal of Neuroscience.

This project has been submitted to Neuron and Nature Neuroscience previously in different forms, 
so some scripts are to generate figures from older versions of the paper are also in this folder 
or scripts of analyses I never ended up using.
